 ## Up for a challenge? (optional)
- You may include background audio/sound effects but make sure there are controls to pause and play the audio on either project ideas.
- You can include difficulty levels for the user to specify at the beginning on either project ideas.
Mandatory Requirements for your JavaScript front end project:
Information Architecture:
- Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap
to accomplish this).
- Incorporate a footer at the bottom of each page.

 # Attribution:
- Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources using
clear comments. Include the url of where you found the code (e.g. libraries or tutorials).
# Documentation:
- Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users. Attribute any code from other sources. Document all testing procedures and findings.
- Use ‘markdown’ when writing your README.md file.
